# Candidates API 404 Fix - Resolution Summary

## Issue
The endpoint `GET /api/v1/candidates` was returning **404 Not Found** while `GET /api/v1/candidates/` (with trailing slash) was working correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. FastAPI Configuration Issue
- The FastAPI app was configured with `redirect_slashes=False` in `app/main.py`
- This disabled automatic URL redirections between paths with and without trailing slashes
- The candidates router defined routes as `/` which combined with prefix `/api/v1/candidates` created `/api/v1/candidates/`
- Without redirect_slashes, `/api/v1/candidates` would not automatically redirect to `/api/v1/candidates/`

### 2. Router Registration
```python
# In app/main.py
app.include_router(candidates_router, prefix="/api/v1/candidates", tags=["candidates"])

# In app/api/candidates.py  
@router.get("/", response_model=List[Candidate])  # This creates /api/v1/candidates/
```

## Solution Applied

### Fixed FastAPI Configuration
**File: `app/main.py`**
```python
# BEFORE (causing 404):
app = FastAPI(
    title="HireIQ Pro - Smart Hiring System API",
    description="AI-powered bias detection and intelligent hiring platform with LangChain, Langfuse, and n8n integration", 
    version="2.0.0",
    redirect_slashes=False  # ❌ This was causing the issue
)

# AFTER (fixed):
app = FastAPI(
    title="HireIQ Pro - Smart Hiring System API",
    description="AI-powered bias detection and intelligent hiring platform with LangChain, Langfuse, and n8n integration",
    version="2.0.0", 
    redirect_slashes=True   # ✅ This enables automatic slash handling
)
```

## Verification

### Test Results
✅ **http://localhost:8000/api/v1/candidates** - Now works (was 404)
✅ **http://localhost:8000/api/v1/candidates/** - Still works  
✅ **http://localhost:8000/api/v1/candidates/debug** - Still works

### Server Logs Confirm Fix
```
INFO:app.api.candidates:GET /candidates called with skip=0, limit=100, position=None, is_active=None
INFO:app.api.candidates:Loading candidates from: C:\Users\warre\vibathon\Vibathon\backend\candidates.json
INFO:app.api.candidates:File exists: True
INFO:app.api.candidates:Successfully loaded 100 candidates
INFO:app.api.candidates:Loaded 100 candidates from file
INFO:app.api.candidates:Returning 100 candidates after filtering and pagination
INFO:app.api.candidates:Successfully converted 100 candidates to Pydantic models
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **`app/main.py`** - Changed `redirect_slashes=False` to `redirect_slashes=True`

### Files Analyzed
1. **`app/main.py`** - FastAPI app configuration and router registration
2. **`app/api/candidates.py`** - Router endpoints and data handling
3. **`candidates.json`** - Data file (93,427 bytes, 100 candidates)
4. **`app/models/schemas.py`** - Pydantic models

### Why This Fix Works
- `redirect_slashes=True` enables FastAPI to automatically handle URL path variations
- When a request comes to `/api/v1/candidates`, FastAPI now automatically redirects to `/api/v1/candidates/`
- This maintains backward compatibility while fixing the 404 issue
- No changes needed to existing frontend code or API consumers

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The candidates API endpoint is now fully functional for both URL patterns:
- `/api/v1/candidates` (without trailing slash)  
- `/api/v1/candidates/` (with trailing slash)

All existing functionality remains intact, and the API is ready for production use.
